# AddToCartProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.2.\
This is an Angular project that demonstrates how to add and handle a shopping cart using fake API data. The application allows users to browse through different categories of products, add items to their cart, remove items from their cart, and update the quantity of items in their cart. The project also uses 'localStorage' to persist cart items across sessions and 'ngx-toastr' to display notifications when items are added or removed from the cart.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
